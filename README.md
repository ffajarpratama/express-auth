## Express - Auth

#### _Express.js Authentication Starter Kit_

Express-Auth is an authentication starter kit for Express.js, at least for me ðŸ™ƒ
(but I'm considering to publish it to NPM, or should I?)

#### Features

Some features included in this starter kit:

- Google Sign In
- Registration by Email or Username
- Email Verification
- Re-sending Email Verification
- Reset Password by Email
- Re-sending Reset Password Email

#### Tech

Some of the technologies I used to develop this:

- [node.js] - the back-end JavaScript runtime environment
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
- [Nodemailer] - module for email sending in node.js
- [Sequelize] - a node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server
- [PostgreSQL] - the database for storing user-related stuffs
- [ejs] - as the view engine. I like to keep things simple...

I also use several packages to validate inputs and do basic stuffs. You can look at it in the `package.json`

[sequelize]: https://sequelize.org/master/
[postgresql]: https://www.postgresql.org/about/
